WorkPermitCloud is an innovative legal and HR-tech company that specialises in business immigration and HR systems in the UK.

##What is an HR management system?

A human resources management system helps organisations manage their human resources, such as employee records, payroll, performance, and compliance with UKVI rules. This system is designed to make HR processes simpler and more efficient while ensuring the accessibility of all relevant information in one place.

##How Does an HRMS Work?

Cloud HR software consists of a centralised database that stores employee records. Authorised personnel can access this database through web browsers or mobile phones. The system also includes various tools to help manage employee records like performance review templates, contract management tools and absence tracking

##Who uses it? / Why do you need an HR Management System?

Human Resource Management Systems offer several advantages for organisations. Perhaps the most significant benefit is that they can help save time and money by automating HR processes. They can help improve compliance with UKVI sponsorship rules and provide a centralised location for all employee records.

As a UK employer, if you're sponsoring migrant workers from overseas, it is a requirement from Home Office that you must have a robust HR system in place to monitor your employees. As a licensed sponsor, you need to carry out sponsor duties, which require record-keeping and reporting, a robust HR system will help you to comply with your duties in order to maintain your sponsor license. Failing to comply with your sponsor duties may result in your sponsorship licence being suspended, revoked or withdrawn.

##Manage your Sponsorship Licence with WpcHr Software

Strong adherence to these HR processes helps organisations to follow Home Office guidance of sponsorship compliance.
