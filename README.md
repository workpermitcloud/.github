What is an HR management system?

A human resources management system helps organisations manage their human resources, such as employee records, payroll, performance, and compliance with UKVI rules. This system is designed to make HR processes simpler and more efficient while ensuring the accessibility of all relevant information in one place.

How Does an HRMS Work?

Cloud HR software consists of a centralised database that stores employee records. Authorised personnel can access this database through web browsers or mobile phones. The system also includes various tools to help manage employee records like performance review templates, contract management tools and absence tracking.
